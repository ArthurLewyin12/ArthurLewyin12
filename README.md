👋 Hi, I’m @ArthurLewyin12
👀 I’m interested in building full-stack applications and desktop software.
🌱 I’m currently learning Next.js, Docker, and improving my skills in React, TypeScript, and Tauri for desktop applications.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving web development (Next.js, Laravel, AdonisJS) and desktop applications using Tauri.

⚡ Fun fact: I’m also diving into DevOps with Docker while balancing Python and Java development!
